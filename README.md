## Prompt
When designing the website, we aimed to keep playfulness and youth in mind, incorporating fun (but still legible) fonts and cute navigation items into a colorful palate - while still maintaining ease-of-use.

## Implementation
The implementation of the design wasn't too difficult - we used basic CSS to build out most of the background design and styling, plus a little bit of JS to help with dynamic navigation.  

There's also a custom slides implementation that we created for the project, focusing mostly on using CSS and minimal JS for the interactive element.
