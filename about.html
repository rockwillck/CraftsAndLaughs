        <h2>Why Us?</h2>
        <p>Despite our diverse cultural backgrounds, all of our founders are joined by a common thread - giving gifts. We've all seen how one simple act can unite families and strengthen communities. Inspired by our own experiences in hospitals, where we felt isolation and a longing for warmth, Crafts & Laughs was born. We aim to combine our passion for the arts with a personal touch, providing children with meaningful gifts that brighten their hospital stays and offer comfort during uncertain moments.</p>

        <p>Hi! My name is Juhi Bhatt, and I am a senior in high school. I have loved making crafts since I was a child because it allows me to use my creativity to bring my imagination to life. Personal and handmade gifts have always been important to me, as they can make others feel special. Crafting is also a stress-relieving process for me. It has become a vital part of who I am and what I value, and I hope it brings others as much joy as it brings me.</p>

        <p>Hello! I am Ravine Cohen and I am a high school senior in Houston. Making art has remained a passion of mine as I’ve grown up. It has become a vital part of how I perceive the world and how I show my appreciation for those around me. Sometimes art is about being present, sometimes it is self-expression, and sometimes it is exactly what’s needed to lift someone’s spirits. I hope to share the joy of creating and gifting with others who want to make the world a little more colorful.</p>

        <p>Hello! I am William Choi-Kim, and I am a junior in high school. I've been passionate about art and creating since my formative years in elementary school, and giving back and volunteering has remained a part of my life for longer than I can remember. Of course, I've also always been a code nerd at heart, so I'm responsible for... well, this website! I also manage finances for Crafts & Laughs, and I'm excited to have the chance to join my interests here.</p>	</div>
