        <h2>What is a Chapter?</h2>
        <p>A chapter is a local or regional branch of an organization (like a club) that operates under the main branch. Chapters share the same mission and goals, carrying out programs and activities to serve their specific communities. While they have some autonomy, chapters adhere to the guidelines and policies set by the main organization, ensuring consistency and alignment across all branches.</p>
        <h2>Why Start a Chapter?</h2>
        <p>Starting a chapter lets you bring Crafts for Care's mission to your community. While we aim to reach many places, our team can only do so much from afar. By starting a chapter, you can make a positive local impact, support kids in hospitals, help peers de-stress, and develop leadership and communication skills. You'll also share and learn new crafts, innovate, and spread love in your community.</p>
        <h2>How to Start a Chapter</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine your motive for starting a chapter and think of ways you will achieve your goals and if you want to make your chapter a school club, city based organization, or state based organization.</li>
            <li>If your chapter is a school club then fill out necessary paperwork and register your club within your school.</li>
            <li>Register your chapter as a Crafts for Care chapter by filling out the form in the section below.</li>
            <li>After your chapter has been approved, assemble your officer team, which includes positions you believe necessary.</li>
            <li>Create social media accounts for your chapter (Instagram, Tik Tok, and others) and promote your chapter. You can create flyers, tell your friends or classmates, post on social media, or have booths at your school at the beginning of the year.</li>
            <li>Reach out to local hospitals and find one that takes handmade donations or monetary donations.</li>
            <li>Brainstorm ideas for events or meetings.</li>
            <li>Create innovative incentives/ways to get members involved and engorged to work for this cause. You can also reach out to other clubs or organizations to create a combined event for members.</li>
        </ol>
