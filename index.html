		<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
		<p>Crafts & Laughs is a nonprofit organization dedicated to teaching others how to create handmade crafts to donate and gift. Our mission is to be a platform for members to learn and create - by following our guided tutorials, by joining a chapter, or just by using their imagination. We collect handmade creations and donate to children battling illness, hoping to bring a smile to their faces or a sense of comfort to their hearts.
		</p>
		<h2>Why Are We Doing This?</h2>
		<p>Art can't cure cancer, it can't end world hunger, it can't fix a broken relationship. But it can be a small glimmer of hope for someone in any of those situations. That's what Crafts & Laughs is about - being the lone star in the sky for those struggling with mental health, the one there for the entire community.</p>
