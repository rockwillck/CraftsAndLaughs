        <h2>Why Donate?</h2>
        <p>When you donate to Crafts & Laughs, you're providing emotional support and comfort to children facing hospitalization and the mental health challenges that come with stays in a hospital. Your handmade items are tangible expressions of your love and care - and as simple an act as it might be to <i>give</i>, it's nonetheless so meaningful an act to <i>receive</i>. And for you, the act of creating, of making art, helps your mental health and reduces the burden on your shoulders, all while enhancing your sense of self and your sense of purpose. We can make a difference, as artists and as students, <mark>together</mark>.</p>
        <h2>Why Hospitals, Why Children?</h2>
        <p>Children in hospitals often face challenging and frightening experiences that can leave them isolated and anxious. This is a feeling we, the founders, know too well, and a feeling we wish on nobody else. Our mission is to bring a touch of warmth and joy to these children's lives during their stays, our gifts a small way to nurture a more positive and welcoming environment. Our gifts are a way of showing that <i>someone</i> is there, that someone cares. We hope to uplift spirits, boost morale - remind these children that they are not alone in their journey.</p>
        <h2>Guidelines for Crafting</h2>
